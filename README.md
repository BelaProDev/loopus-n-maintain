## Architecture

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
The application uses Vite's SSR capabilities for:
- Improved initial page load performance
- Better SEO
- Hydration of client-side React components

### Database
- Primary: MongoDB for persistent storage
- Fallback: Local JSON for offline functionality
- Connection pooling and automatic reconnection handling

### PWA Features
- Service Worker for offline capabilities
- Background sync for offline data
- Push notifications support
- Installable on mobile devices

### Security
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Password-protected admin area
- CORS and XSS protection
- Rate limiting on API routes

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Components: `src/components/`
- Pages: `src/pages/`
- Database queries: `src/lib/mongodb/`
- Types: `src/types/`
- Utilities: `src/lib/`

### Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Use React Query for data fetching
- Implement error boundaries
- Follow accessibility guidelines

## Production Deployment

1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
npm run start
```

3. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
